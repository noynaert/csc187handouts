# 10.085 Java Beans

Some classes are more about doing things (such as the Scanner class)

The kind of class we are emphasizing this semester represent entities that often have real-world representations.  These kinds of Classes are often implemented as "Java Beans"

* Java Beans implement the serializable interface (but we won't worry about that too much right now)
* Java Beans have private data fields
* Access to the data fields are done using setters and getters using standardized formats
* Java Beans have a default constructor
