## The problem of naming things

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.     -- Phil Karlton

## What about a namespace for Classes?

But what about names of classes?  Is there a way to protect class names so we don't have to worry about duplicating them?  

Yes, there are!  There is something called a package.  But then the question becomes how do we make sure that package names are protected from duplication?

## Domain Names

Internet domains are guaranteed to be unique to a single organization on a worldwide basis.

Domain names are a hierarchy.  The way they are normally written, the most general level is last.

1. (Highest) Top Level Domain, or TLD
2. (Lower) Second Level Domain, or SLD
3. (Lowest) Subdomains

The SLD plus the TLD are often called the "Domain Name."  

Domains at the TLD and SLD are registered worldwide.

Subdomains are completely under control of the owner of the SLD.

## Reverse order domain names

Package names for third-party begin with the domain name in reverse order.

For example, I own the domain noynaert.com.  So if I start my package names with `com.noynaert` Then I should not have a problem with anyone else duplicating my package names.

It is up the owner of the domain name to make sure there are no duplicate package names within their organization.

## Organization in Java

The package name is broken up into parts separated by periods.  Each segment of the name becomes a directory.  The classes are place within the directory structure based on the package name.
