# 10.040 Create a Package and a Class

Package names are divided into part separated by periods.

## Our package names

If you own your own domain name you may use it.

Otherwise, we will use edu.missouriwestern.[your login id]

Your login id is unique to you.  After that you may use any system you wish.
 
## Packages and directory structure

Each part of the package name becomes a folder or a directory on the operating system.

## Create the class in the lowest level of your directory structure.

In IntelliJ, right click on src
