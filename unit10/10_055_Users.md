# 10.055 Users and Secure Practices

In a large enterprise, a class would be assigned to a programmer or team of programmers to maintain.  They are responsible for making sure the class does exactly what its description says it does.

## Who is the user?

When we write classes, the "user" is another programmer (or ourself) that uses the class and objects created as instances of the class.

Data fields should usually be protected from users.  

* Protection from intentional changes
  * Unauthorized shortcuts
  * Accidental changes

* Final fields (constants) are protected from user errors by definition
* Non-final fields should be made `private`
  * Access will be controlled through public methods that prevent intentional or accidental changes

## You may be both the person who created the class and its user

We have seen how getting a method to work means we don't have to be too concerned about it working correctly.

We want the same level of confidence for the entire class.
