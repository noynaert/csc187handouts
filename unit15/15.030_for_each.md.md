# 15.030 For Each Loop

There is a special form of the for loop that works well with ArrayLists and in some other situations.  It is called a "for each loop."

A print routine would look like the following:

```java
public static void print(ArrayList<String> list){
     for(String item: list){
	     System.out.println(item);
     }
}
```

Same code, but as a generic:

```java
public static<E> void print(ArrayList<E> list){  
   for(E item: list){  
       System.out.println(item);  
   }  
}
```

In the above text `String item` is declaring a variable called item of type String.  the : list means refers to the list the items to be taken from.  The for statement could be read as "for each item in the list"


There is no index involved.  If your application needs an index you should use a regular for loop.  But many applications do not need an index.
