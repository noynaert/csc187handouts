15.020 ArrayList

## Advantages over Arrays

* Capacity is not fixed; Capacity can increase as necessary
  * No need to guess the ultimate size
* An ArrayList acts like an array is always full
  * There is no need to worry about tracking n.  The size of the ArrayList always gives n.
* There isn't much emphasis on the index.  But an index operation is available in a method.

## How ArrayLists grow

ArrayLists start with a fixed physical size.  If that size fills up, it is doubled.  Doubling is slow, so if we can guess a reasonable size it is usually a good idea to do so.

## Looking at the ArrayList API

### Two Constructors for now

* `ArrayList()` Creates a physical capacity of 10 elements
* `ArrayList(int initialCapacity)`

### Generic Type
You must specify the data type of that the ArrayList will hold.  
```java

//Older version of Java
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();

//Newer version of Java
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
```

### Important methods to get started with

* `.add(E e)`
* `.clear()` --Empties the list
* `.contains(Object o)` Returns a boolean if the object is in the list.  It is based on .equals()
* `.get(int index)`
* `.isEmpty()`
* `.remove(Object o)`
* `.size()` 
* `.toArray()` 

## Limitation -- Only works with Objects

ArrayLists only work with Objects.  They cannot hold primitive data types.  However, they can hold instances of the wrapper classes.
