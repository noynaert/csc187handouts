## Software

### Java Compiler and Run Time Environment

You can check your computer for Java.  Run the following commands at the command line.

```text
java --version
javac --version
```

Both commands should show version 17 (or later)

#### Linux

I suggest using the default JRE and JDK for your operating system.  The following should work for Debian, Ubuntu, and their downstream distributions:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install default-jre
    sudo apt install default-jdk

#### Windows

Although I favor the openJDK and openJRE, the Oracle installer seem easiest to install on Windows 11:

[https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_windows-x64_bin.msi](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_windows-x64_bin.msi)

#### Mac

[https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_macos-x64_bin.dmg ](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_macos-x64_bin.dmg )

### JetBrains IntelliJ IDE
