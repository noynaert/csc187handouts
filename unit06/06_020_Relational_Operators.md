## Primitives Only!

Relational Operators only apply to primitive data types.

Relational Operators do not apply to instances of classes.  The most important application of this is probably strings.  Objects that are likely to be compared to each other for things like less than or equals often have methods that do the comparison.  One example is the String equals() method.
