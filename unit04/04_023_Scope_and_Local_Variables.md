# 04.023 Scope and Local Variables

Methods may declare variables.  Any variables declared inside a method are *local* to the method.  It does not matter if other variables use the same id.  

## Scope

Scope is the area of a program in which an element is available for use in a program.
Usually the element is a variable.

So far all of the variables we have declared are limited in their scope to just the function where they are declared.
