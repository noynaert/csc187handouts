# 01.020 First Program Setup

## Start a New Project

1. Click on the New Project button at the top of the window.
1. Give a title.  Capitalization doesn't matter.  I suggest lower case.  Something like "printing" would be a good title this time.  
1. You can use IdeaProjects or some other foler of your choice.
1. For now, ***UNCHECK*** the "Add Sample Code" checkbox.  
   * On the first exam you will need to write a complete program from scratch.  It will be good for you to practice typing the code manually.  After the first exam, I suggest that you click "Add sample code" but do not check "Generate code with onboarding tips"
1. Click "Create" at the bottom of the window.

## Where do I put my code?

To start, you will create a "Java Class" in the folder labeled "src".

1. ***Right*** click on src.
1. Select "New"
1. Select "Java Class"  ![src/New/Java Class](images/javaclass.png)

### The class name is important

* Proper Java style requires that class names must be capitalized.  The IDE will allow you to create them in lower case.  They will compile properly.  But it is bad style.
* A new file is created with the file name "Print.java"
![creating the class](!images/../images/PrintingClass.png)
* Java requires that each `public` class must be in a file that has the same name as the class.
  * The file name will need to end in .java
  * The capitalization of the file name must match the capitalization of the class.

Your code should now look like this|The file structure is like this: ![public class Print](images/theClass.png)
