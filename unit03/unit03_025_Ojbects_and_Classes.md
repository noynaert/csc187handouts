## Primitive data types

## What are classes?

Classes are data types.  But they hold collections of primitive data types and other classes.

(Use LocalDate as an example)

A class describes two different things.  

* One is the data itself. The data may be primative data types or other classes. 
* The other is a list of the operations that you can perform on that type of data.
