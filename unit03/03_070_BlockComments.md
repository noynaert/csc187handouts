# 03.070 Block Comments

Block comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.  Everything between the symbols is a comment.

The block comment can go anywhere a blank would go (outside of a String literal). 

Normally block comments span several lines.

Some IDEs will put an `*` on the left in a multiline comment, but it is not needed.  The extra `*` may help readability.

```java
/* This is a comment */

/*
 * This is also a comment
 * That spans several lines.
 * The * on the left is just for readability.
 */
```
