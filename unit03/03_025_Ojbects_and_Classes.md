# 03.025 Classes and Objects

## Primitive data types

Primitive data types only represent data types of a fixed size and fixed operations.

Java has 8 primitive types:

Data Type|	Default Value (for fields)
:---|:---:
byte|0
short|0
int|0
long|0L
float|0.0f
double|0.0
char|'\u0000'
boolean|false
## What are classes?

Classes are data types.  But they hold collections of primitive data types and other classes.

All classes have an initial value of null.

A class describes two different things.  

* One is the data itself. The data may be primitive data types or other classes. 
* The other is a list of the operations that you can perform on that type of data.

## The Java API

All classes are at [https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/allclasses-index.html](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/allclasses-index.html)  Then use the local search bar.

Usually the best way is to do a search on "java 17 api " followed by the class name.  

Common Class API examples:

* [String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html)
* [Scanner](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Scanner.html)
* [LocalDate](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/LocalDate.html)
