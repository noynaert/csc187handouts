# 03.040 Strings and Concatination

In the previous chapter I snuck in "concatination."  Concatination is adding two strings together.  There are a few different ways to do concatination, but by far the most common is simply using a plus sign.

```java
String alphabet = "abcd" + "efg";
System.out.println(alphabet);
```


Make a skeleton program and try each of the following statements.  If one of them gives you a syntax error, figure out why it is wrong or will not work.

* System.out.println("I am " + 19 + " years old);
* System.out.println("I am " + (2023 - 2004) + " years old.");
* System.out.println("I am " + (2023 - 2004) + " years old.");
* System.out.println("8" + "3" + (10+5));
