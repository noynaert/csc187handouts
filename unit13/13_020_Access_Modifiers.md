## The four access modifiers

* **public**
  * Least restrictive
  * All other classes may access the item
* **protected**
  * Access by two groups
    * Members of the same package
    * Subclasses
* (**default** -- **no modifier**)
  * Only members of the same package may access the item
  * I remember this as "Package Private"
* **private**
  * Most restrictive
  * Only members of the class can access the item
