# 01.010 Programming and Comptuer Science

[*Thinking Java* textbook](https://greenteapress.com/thinkjava6/thinkjava.pdf) Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

## Computer Science is the study of Algorithms

## Programming

## Programming Languages

## Strategy for this course

* Teach Java syntax
* Teach problem solving
* Teach programmatic thinking
* Prepare for algorithmic and Object Oriented thinking

### "Objects Early" or "Objects Late"

We will talk about *using* objects early.  We will talk about *creating* objects late.

CSC 254 is about Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Very crude family tree of Java

* FORTRAN
  * ALGOL
    * Pascal
      * C
        * Ansi C
          * C++
            * Java

### The good about Java

* Java is based on C++
* Java is ruthelessly Object Oriented
* Java is good for large projects
  * Large in terms of amount of code
  * Large in terms of teams working on the program
* Java is good for projects where reliability is important
* Java implementations are consistent

### The bad about Java

* Java is based on C++
* Java tends to be verbose
* Frameworks are not built in
* Java lacks some control structures or has inferior forms of control structures
  * These are being fixed slowly over time.
* Java lacks some built-in data structures
  * Most of them are added with modules
  * Sometimes the added modules allow different implementations and features.

"Java is a good language.  It was rushed to market before it became a great language"
