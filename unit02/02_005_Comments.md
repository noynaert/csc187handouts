# 02.005 Comments

Comments are ignored by Java.  They are ways to leave notes to yourself and to other programmers.

Java has three different types of comments.  We will only do the simplest form here.

## '//' Comment

Two forward slashes mark the rest of the line as a comment.  It is usually used to make a comment about a statement at the beginning of the line.

If // appears at the beginning of a line means the entire line is a comment.

If you are a Python or JavaScript programmer, then `//` is the same as the `#` comments in most scripting languages.

## Can you have too many comments?

Some people think you have to document everything with comments.  

Generally, ***self-documenting code*** is a better form of documentation than excessive numbers of comments.
