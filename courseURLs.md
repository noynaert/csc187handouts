## Software

### Java Compiler and Run Time Environment

#### Linux

I suggest using the default JRE and JDK for your operating system.  The following should work for Debian, Ubuntu, and their downstream distributions:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install default-jre
    sudo apt install default-jdk

#### Windows

Although I favor the openJDK and openJRE, the Oracle installer seem easiest to install on Windows 11:

[https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_windows-x64_bin.msi](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_windows-x64_bin.msi)

#### Mac

[https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_macos-x64_bin.dmg ](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_macos-x64_bin.dmg )

### JetBrains IntelliJ IDE

First, register your MWSU account.  This will give you free access to the "Ultimate" version of IntelliJ.

Go to [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=linux](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=linux).  Download and install the version appropriate for your operating system
